# raspberry-pi-pico
projects using rp2

led blinking: flashes the led of the raspberry pi pico

tests: miscellaneous code (with some help from chatgpt)

Note that these files all need a program which can run MicroPython, as the pi pico is a microprocessor.

I reccomend to use Thonny but you can use whichever program you want.
